= INSTR

Returns the position in the string that is the first character of a specified occurrence of the substring.
The first position in the string is 1. 
If substring is not found in string, then the INSTR function will return 0.			
If the start_position is negative, the INSTR function counts back start_position number of characters from the end of string and then searches towards the beginning of string.
