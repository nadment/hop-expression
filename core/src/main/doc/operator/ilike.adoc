= ILIKE

Case-insensitive matching of strings based on comparison with a pattern.
SQL wildcards are supported in pattern:
	An underscore(_) matches any single character.
	A percent sign (%) matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
	
The escape character instructs the operator to treat the wildcard characters as the regular characters.
