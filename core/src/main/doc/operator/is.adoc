= IS NULL, IS NOT NULL, IS TRUE, IS FALSE

Check whether a value is or is not null, true or false.

== Syntax
----
IS [NOT] TRUE|FALSE|NULL
----


NOTE: Do not write expression = NULL because NULL is not "equal to" NULL. (The null value represents an unknown value, and it is not known whether two unknown values are equal.)
