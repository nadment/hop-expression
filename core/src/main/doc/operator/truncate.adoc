= TRUNCATE, TRUNC

When a numeric argument is specified, rounds the input expression down to the nearest (or equal) integer closer to zero, or to the nearest equal or smaller value with the specified number of places after the decimal point.

When used with a date or timestamp, truncates the timestamp to a date (day) value and returns a timestamp with or without time zone depending on type of the argument. 

== Syntax
----
TRUNCATE(numeric, scale)
TRUNC(numeric, scale)

== Usage

* Truncation is performed towards 0, not towards the smaller number. For example, TRUNCATE(-9.6) results in -9, not -10.
* If either the input or the scale is NULL, then the result is NULL.
