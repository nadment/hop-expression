= CAST

Converts a value of one data type into another data type:

== Syntax
----
CAST(value AS dataType [FORMAT format])
----

== Usage

==== Supported data type:

* BigNumber		
*	Binary
*	Boolean
*	Date
*	Integer
*	Number
*	String

==== Rules

* When converting a number to a boolean, 0 is false and every other value is true. 
* When converting a boolean to a number, false is 0 and true is 1. 
* When converting a number to a number of another type, the value is checked for overflow. 
* When converting a string to binary, it is hex encoded (every byte two characters).

==== Format

[DEV] What to use java format or SQL format ? For now SQL except for String to Number


If the cast is not possible, an error is raised.

== Example

----
CAST('yes' AS BOOLEAN)
CAST('-1234.56' AS INTEGER FORMAT '###0')
CAST('-1234.56' AS NUMBER FORMAT '###0.00')
CAST('24/05/2020 00:00:00' AS DATE FORMAT 'DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm:ss')
CAST(Date(2020,5,24) AS STRING FORMAT 'yyyy-q')
----
